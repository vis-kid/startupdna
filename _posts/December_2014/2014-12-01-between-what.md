Over the last couple of years I’ve listened to my fair share of podcasts about web stuff. There are plenty of great podcasts out there and I have an enormous respect for them. The Ruby, Javascript and Design communities can feel very lucky and proud to have so many ambitious people producing great shows spreading knowledge. Nevertheless I was missing something …

This project has a simple goal in mind: Producing short knowledge bombs about design & web technologies from interviews with interesting people in the industry and include beginners / newbies in the conversation. I intend to make it a regular show that is about learning from experts who share their knowledge and their experiences. Interviews will be edited into multiple episodes no longer than 15-20 minutes which makes it easy to fit them into busy lifestyles while folks commute, work out, eat breakfast, travel, clean the dishes or simply walk their dog during lunch break.

There are tons of people who are not in the fortunate position to have access to the fantastic learning infrastructure / meetup ecosystem that the infamous tech hubs so effortlessly and abundantly provide. I hope this project also creates value for folks who feel cut off simply because they live some place remote where the next networking / meetup opportunities to learn from friendly advanced people are far away. Being broke or unable to afford premium resources to advance one’s skill level certainly affect another big chunk of people as well. I’ve been there and it’s not the best place to learn and grow, especially if you don’t have regular access to people who are far beyond your level of skill and who wanna share their knowledge. Therefore I will keep this project free, open and easily accessible. Hopefully it makes a small contribution spreading knowledge about web technologies among peeps in the industry and newcomers alike.
